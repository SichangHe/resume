### Developing and maintaining an Open Source scraper (2022/06 - )

Steven learned from his design mistakes in the SSO scraper and
made a simplified Open Source version of the
[scraper](https://github.com/SichangHe/scraper)
without using mutexes or channels.
It is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/recursive_scraper).
