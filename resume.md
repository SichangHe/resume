## Events

### Maintaining and developing mdbook-katex (2022/11 - )

Steven took over
[mdbook-katex on GitHub](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex),
a katex preprocessor for mdBook in Rust,
to maintain and develop it.
He fixed the CIs for MUSL Linux and Windows build,
fixed the preprocessor to respect the fenced code block CommonMark
specification,
and added new features such as MathML support.

### Forum using Ruby on Rails (2022/06 - 2022/08)

Steven built an [forum](https://github.com/SichangHe/forum)
using Ruby on Rails and deployed it on Heroku for demonstration purpose.
The forum has features such as infinitely nested comments and MathJax support.

### SSO member (2021/12 - )

SSO is a search engine research project at DKU lead by Professor Jiang Long.

Steven wrote a feature-rich web scraper in async Rust for SSO.
He also helped the team develop its web server using Django in Python.
He practiced HTML, ECMAScript, and Tailwindcss for the frontend,
Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for the database,
and Git for version management and teamwork.

The scraper had run daily flawlessly since its final deployment.
It helped the team find 368 broken links on DKU website which
Steven reported upstream on March 14, 2022.

### Developing and maintaining an Open Source scraper (2022/06 - )

Steven learned from his design mistakes in the SSO scraper and
made a simplified Open Source version of the
[scraper](https://github.com/SichangHe/scraper)
without using mutexes or channels.
It is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/recursive_scraper).

### Academic Resource Center (ARC) tutor (2021/05 - )

Steven obtained a CRLA Certificate working as
a tutor at the ARC.
He enjoyed tutoring MATH 201 (Multivariate Calculus),
MATH 105 (Calculus), and COMPSCI 201
(Algorithms and Data Structures).

### Teaching assistant (TA) for COMPSCI 201 (2021/11 - 2022/03)

Steven worked as a TA for COMPSCI 201.
Besides hosting Lab sessions and office hours,
he helped simplify the setup of the development environment
and made text-based and
[video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiL-ULPBkvE&t=22s).

### PageRank of DKU's website (2021/10 - 2021/11)

Steven calculated the PageRank of DKU's website
and made it his STATS 210 (Probability and Statistics) project.

He scraped around 8000 webpages using Scrapy
and calculated the PageRank as a Markov chain using Numpy.
During this time,
Steven saw that DKU's website had weird problems like infinite recursive URLs
and poor performance.
He was also unsatisfied about Scrapy.
These observations motivated Steven to build the scraper
and learn web development.

### Intersection editor and translator (2021/06 - )

These articles were published on Intersection's WeChat public account
and its website.

### DKU courses (2020 - )

Steven took mainly mathematics courses including Analysis,
Ordinary Differential Equations,

and Statistics.
He also took Computer Science courses on algorithm, systems,
machine learning, and functional programming,
the entry courses for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology,
and some lighter History and Information Science courses.
